  instructions:
    'In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks; set aside. In a medium saucepan stir together the sugar, cornstarch or flour, and cocoa.  Stir in the milk.  Cook and stir over medium heat till bubbly.  Cook and stir for 2 minutes more.  Remove from heat.  Gradually stir 1 cup of the milk mixture into the egg yolks.  Add egg mixture to the milk mixture in the saucepan.  Return to heat and bring to a gentle boil.  Reduce heat.  Cook and stir for 2 minutes more.  Remove from heat.  Stir in butter and vanilla.  Pour into bowls, cool for a few minutes. \n While pudding cools off enough to eat it, toast bread slices and then butter them.  Cut the toast into strips and dip them into the pudding instead of eating the pudding with a spoon.'
